                <h2><b>About</b></h2>
                <p align="justify">My name is Yahoo Garfield Manik, i'm is Front End Web Dev. Why do we need to learn coding? Coding is one way that can be chosen to hone mindsets and problem solving skills and get used to displaying creativity. Becoming a programmer will form a person who thinks in a structured, systematic and
                    efficient manner.That's right, by learning to code or program a computer, we will learn how to think well, structured, systematic and efficient. It will be very useful in our life, especially in solving our problems. And the most important
                    thing is, when we have coding skills, we will be free to work. We have a brilliant idea to create an application or web that will solve many problems, if we have coding skills, we just need to make it. We will be free to develop ideas.
                    Not limited to our inability to make it. When we have an idea to make a good game, we just have to make it.

          </b>
                    <p align="justify">When learning to code, such as making a simple game, children's cognitive abilities will develop. These cognitive aspects include the ability to solve problems, logical thinking skills, critical thinking skills, and systematically
                        can be honed.</p>

          </b>
                    <p align="justify">By learning to code, children can improve their ability to understand the concept of algorithms. So, they can learn to solve problems will develop rapidly. Then, they can break it down into concrete, workable steps.</p>

          </b>
                    <p align="justify">Learning to code can increase children's creativity. Moreover, various processes and variations in finding solutions in the coding process encourage children to think outside the box. They are encouraged to use imagination in developing
                        a game or application. For example, when learning to display images, or even making an application development innovation. This is what can trigger their creativity.</p>

                        logical, and creative thinking, children can also be more persistent in trying to create something new and solve existing problems. These abilities are a package of soft skills abilities that children can get when learning coding.</p>
